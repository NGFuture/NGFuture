Hey there! Welcome to my Github repository! I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building awesome web and mobile applications that not only look great but also work seamlessly. With over 2 years of experience in the field, I have a deep understanding of math and data structures, which enables me to solve complex problems with ease.

I'm always eager to learn and stay on top of the latest technologies, so I'm constantly exploring new frameworks, tools, and languages to improve my skills and knowledge. As a Full-stack Developer, I'm proficient in various front-end technologies such as React.js, Typescript, React Native, Next.js, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, and Rest API. I also have expertise in back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Elastic Search, API, and Ruby on Rails.

In addition to development, I also love UI/UX design, and I'm skilled in using Figma, Adobe XD, and Photoshop to create beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. I'm also familiar with database solutions like PostgreSQL, Firebase, Firestore, Airtable, and SQL.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, enjoying ocean views, or spending time with my family and friends.
